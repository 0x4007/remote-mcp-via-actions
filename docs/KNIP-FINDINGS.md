# Knip Dead Code Analysis - Final Report

## Key Discovery: Dynamic Loading

The MCP servers in the `mcp-servers/` directory are **dynamically loaded** based on the `config.json` file, not through explicit `require()` or `import` statements. This is why Knip's static analysis incorrectly flagged them as unused.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Restored Incorrectly Deleted Files
- **example-calculator**: Restored - it's actively used by the MCP system as evidenced by the working tools (`example-calculator__add`, etc.)

### 2. Correctly Deleted Dead Code
These test files were legitimately unused:
- `tests/mcp-http-bridge.js`
- `tests/mcp-stdio-server.js`
- `tests/test-custom-mcp.js`
- `tests/test-mcp-compliance.js`
- `tests/test-proxy.js`

They weren't:
- Imported by any code
- Referenced in package.json scripts (which use bash scripts instead)
- Part of the Bun test suite

### 3. Fixed Dependencies
- **Removed**: `axios` - was declared but never used
- **Added**: `wrangler` to devDependencies - was used in npm scripts but missing from dependencies

### 4. Updated Knip Configuration

```javascript
module.exports = {
  entry: [
    'src/bridge/server.js',
    'src/cloudflare/worker.js',
  ],
  project: [
    'src/**/*.js'
  ],
  ignore: [
    'tests/mcp-inspector/**',
    // MCP servers are dynamically loaded based on config.json
    // They're not imported via require/import statements
    'mcp-servers/**'
  ]
};
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Static analysis limitations**: Tools like Knip can't detect dynamic loading patterns where directories are scanned at runtime
2. **Configuration-driven architecture**: The MCP servers are loaded based on `mcp-servers/config.json`, which enables/disables servers dynamically
3. **Always verify before deleting**: Testing with actual runtime behavior (like checking `/mcp`) is crucial before removing "unused" code

## Current Status

✅ All legitimate dead code removed
✅ Dynamic MCP servers preserved and working
✅ Dependencies cleaned up
✅ Knip configuration optimized for this codebase

The codebase is now cleaner while preserving all functional components.
