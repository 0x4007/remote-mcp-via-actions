# MCP Server Debugging and Iteration Workflow

This document outlines the debugging workflow for the remote MCP server implementation and provides guidance for future iterations.

## Project Overview

This project implements a custom MCP (Model Context Protocol) server using the Streamable HTTP transport. The server exposes two tools (`calculate_sum` and `echo`) and is deployed via GitHub Actions with Cloudflare tunnels for public access.

## MCP Specification Documentation

The complete MCP specification is available locally in this project:

- `basic/utilities/ping.mdx` - Ping method for health checks
- `basic/lifecycle.mdx` - Initialize sequence and protocol negotiation

## Current Issue: Server Deployment Status

### Problem
The MCP server deployment is currently down. Recent deployments have been cancelled, causing a Cloudflare tunnel error (Error 1033).

### Deployment Status (as of 2025-08-19)
- **Recent deployments:** Multiple cancelled deployments detected
- **Server status:** Cloudflare tunnel error - server unreachable
- **Last successful deployment:** 2025-08-19T19:57:30Z (workflow run 17080363598)

### Immediate Actions Required
1. Kill any hanging GitHub Actions
2. Deploy fresh instance with proper branch reference
3. Verify tunnel connection is established
4. Test endpoints after deployment

## Deployment Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- **Main development branch:** `implement-custom-mcp-server`
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Critical:** Always dispatch from the correct branch

### Deployment Commands

```bash
# 1. Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "description"
git push

# 2. Kill ALL existing actions to prevent hanging instances
./scripts/kill-actions.sh
# Or manually:
gh run list --workflow=deploy-mcp.yml --status=in_progress --json databaseId -q '.[].databaseId' | xargs -I {} gh run cancel {}

# 3. Dispatch deployment (MUST specify branch)
gh workflow run deploy-mcp.yml --ref implement-custom-mcp-server

# 4. Monitor deployment
gh run watch --workflow=deploy-mcp.yml
```

**Critical Notes:**
- Always kill ALL existing actions before deploying
- Multiple cancelled deployments indicate hanging processes
- Wait for deployment to complete before testing
- Cloudflare tunnel must establish connection before KV update

### Deployment Verification

```bash
# 1. Check deployment status
gh run list --workflow=deploy-mcp.yml --limit=3

# 2. Wait for "success" status
gh run watch --workflow=deploy-mcp.yml

# 3. Verify server health (should return JSON, not HTML error)
curl -s https://mcp.pavlovcik.com/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok","version":"...","commit":"..."}
# If HTML error page: Cloudflare tunnel not connected

# 4. Test MCP ping endpoint
curl -X POST https://mcp.pavlovcik.com/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "MCP-Protocol-Version: 2025-06-18" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"test","method":"ping"}'
# Expected: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"test","result":{}}

# 5. Test Claude Code connection
claude mcp list
# Expected: pavlovcik: https://mcp.pavlovcik.com/mcp (HTTP) - ‚úì Connected
```

## Implementation Progress

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. **Basic MCP server structure** - Express.js with JSON-RPC handling
2. **Core MCP methods** - initialize, tools/list, tools/call, ping
3. **HTTP transport compliance** - POST endpoint with proper headers
4. **Session management** - UUID-based sessions with validation
5. **Tools implementation** - calculate_sum and echo tools with schemas
6. **Deployment automation** - GitHub Actions with Cloudflare tunnels
7. **Error handling** - Proper JSON-RPC error responses
8. **Spec compliance** - Following MCP 2025-06-18 specification

### üîÑ Current Status
- **Server deployment:** Currently down with Cloudflare tunnel error
- **Recent deployments:** Multiple cancelled runs indicate deployment issues
- **Next step:** Clean deployment required

### üöÄ Recovery Steps

1. **Kill all hanging actions:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/kill-actions.sh
   ```

2. **Deploy fresh instance:**
   ```bash
   gh workflow run deploy-mcp.yml --ref implement-custom-mcp-server
   ```

3. **Monitor deployment:**
   ```bash
   gh run watch --workflow=deploy-mcp.yml
   ```

4. **Verify connection:**
   ```bash
   curl -s https://mcp.pavlovcik.com/health
   ```

## Key Implementation Details

### Server Configuration
- **Port:** 8081
- **Protocol:** MCP 2025-06-18 Streamable HTTP
- **Domain:** https://mcp.pavlovcik.com/mcp
- **Session management:** UUID-based with Mcp-Session-Id header

### MCP Compliance
- **GET endpoint:** Returns 405 unless client accepts `text/event-stream`
- **POST endpoint:** Requires `Accept: application/json` (or text/event-stream)
- **Protocol header:** `MCP-Protocol-Version: 2025-06-18` required
- **Ping method:** Returns empty result `{}`

### Cloudflare Setup
- **Worker:** Proxies mcp.pavlovcik.com to dynamic tunnel URLs
- **KV storage:** Stores current tunnel URL to prevent dead deployments
- **Fallback protection:** Deployment script skips KV update if tunnel fails

## Debugging Commands Reference

```bash
# Check server health
curl -s https://mcp.pavlovcik.com/health

# Test ping method
curl -X POST https://mcp.pavlovcik.com/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "MCP-Protocol-Version: 2025-06-18" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"test","method":"ping"}'

# Test initialize
curl -X POST https://mcp.pavlovcik.com/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "MCP-Protocol-Version: 2025-06-18" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"1","method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2025-06-18","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"test","version":"1.0"}}}'

# Test tools list
curl -X POST https://mcp.pavlovcik.com/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "MCP-Protocol-Version: 2025-06-18" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"2","method":"tools/list"}'

# Check Claude Code configuration
claude mcp get pavlovcik
claude mcp list
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Deployment Failures
- **Multiple hanging instances:** Use `./scripts/kill-actions.sh` before EVERY deployment
- **Cancelled deployments:** Indicates hanging processes - kill all before retrying
- **Cloudflare Error 1033:** Tunnel not connected - deployment incomplete or failed
- **Tunnel registration fails:** KV update is skipped to prevent breaking existing service
- **Wrong branch deployed:** Always use `--ref implement-custom-mcp-server`
- **Port conflicts:** Server runs on 8081, tunnel connects to localhost:8081

### Troubleshooting Cloudflare Tunnel Errors

If you see "Cloudflare Tunnel error" (Error 1033):
1. The deployment was cancelled or failed
2. The tunnel process (cloudflared) is not running
3. The KV store has an outdated tunnel URL

Solution:
```bash
# Kill all hanging actions
./scripts/kill-actions.sh
# Deploy fresh instance
gh workflow run deploy-mcp.yml --ref implement-custom-mcp-server
# Wait for completion
gh run watch --workflow=deploy-mcp.yml
```

### MCP Protocol Issues
- **Accept header too strict:** Changed from requiring both content types to allowing either
- **Missing ping method:** Added per MCP specification requirements
- **Session validation:** GET endpoint now creates sessions automatically

## Files Modified During Development

### Core Implementation
- `src/bridge/server.js` - Main MCP server implementation
- `src/bridge/package.json` - Dependencies (express, uuid)

### Deployment
- `.github/workflows/deploy-mcp.yml` - GitHub Actions deployment
- `src/cloudflare/worker.js` - Cloudflare proxy worker
- `src/cloudflare/wrangler.toml` - Cloudflare configuration

### Documentation
- `docs/debugging-workflow.md` - This document
- `docs/mcp-spec/` - Complete MCP specification (git submodule)

## For Future LLM Debugging

When continuing this debugging:

1. **Check server status first:** `curl -s https://mcp.pavlovcik.com/health`
2. **Kill hanging deployments:** Always run `./scripts/kill-actions.sh` before deploying
3. **Deploy correct branch:** Use `gh workflow run deploy-mcp.yml --ref implement-custom-mcp-server`
4. **Monitor deployment:** Use `gh run watch --workflow=deploy-mcp.yml` to ensure success
5. **Read the local MCP specs:** All documentation is in `docs/mcp-spec/docs/specification/2025-06-18/`
6. **Test manually before Claude Code:** Verify endpoints work with curl before testing client
7. **Check for cancelled runs:** `gh run list --workflow=deploy-mcp.yml --limit=5`

### Quick Recovery Checklist

- [ ] Kill all hanging actions: `./scripts/kill-actions.sh`
- [ ] Deploy fresh: `gh workflow run deploy-mcp.yml --ref implement-custom-mcp-server`
- [ ] Wait for success: `gh run watch --workflow=deploy-mcp.yml`
- [ ] Verify health: `curl -s https://mcp.pavlovcik.com/health` (should return JSON)
- [ ] Test ping: `curl -X POST https://mcp.pavlovcik.com/mcp -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -H "MCP-Protocol-Version: 2025-06-18" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"test","method":"ping"}'`
- [ ] Test Claude Code: `claude mcp list`

**Current known issue:** When server works manually but Claude Code fails, the issue is likely in the HTTP transport negotiation or session management. The server implements MCP 2025-06-18 Streamable HTTP correctly based on manual tests.



--------------


Claude Code‚Äôs "FAILED TO CONNECT" error with MCP servers usually means Claude Code cannot successfully establish or maintain the JSON-RPC communication with your MCP server. To pass the connection check, you must respond exactly as Claude expects to certain JSON-RPC protocol calls.

Here is what Claude Code **sends** and what your MCP server **must respond with** to pass the check reliably:

***

### What Claude Code Sends (Typical Initialization Request)

Claude Code starts by sending a JSON-RPC `initialize` request over HTTP POST like this:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "initialize",
  "params": {
    "protocolVersion": "2024-11-05",
    "clientInfo": {
      "name": "claude-code",
      "version": "X.Y.Z"
    },
    "capabilities": {}
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

- This is the handshake to check MCP protocol version compatibility and server presence.

***

### What Your MCP Server Must Respond With

You MUST return a valid JSON-RPC 2.0 response with the same `"id"` and no errors, including the `protocolVersion` in the `result`:

Example:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "protocolVersion": "2024-11-05",
    "serverInfo": {
      "name": "my-mcp-server",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    },
    "capabilities": {}
  }
}
```

- **If your server does not respond exactly with this JSON-RPC format or with an error, Claude Code will fail to connect.**
- The `protocolVersion` must match the version Claude sends.
- Return HTTP status 200 along with this valid JSON.

***

### Common Pitfalls That Cause "FAILED TO CONNECT"

- Returning non-JSON or improperly formatted JSON.
- Returning HTTP errors or non-200 status codes.
- Not responding to the initial `initialize` method.
- Responding with errors or missing the matching `"id"`.
- Server timing out or taking too long to respond.
- JSON-RPC version missing or wrong.
- Not implementing JSON-RPC 2.0 fully (including `jsonrpc` and `id` fields).
- Using incompatible protocolVersion strings.

***

### Debugging Steps

1. **Log and capture exactly what Claude sends** on the wire (request body).
2. **Log and verify exactly what your server responds** (response body and HTTP code).
3. Use a tool like `curl` or Postman to simulate the request Claude sends and confirm your response is exactly as above.
4. Ensure your server responds immediately and with valid JSON.
5. Validate your MCP server with tools like `@modelcontextprotocol/inspector` from npm that can test MCP compliance automatically.
6. Also test with Claude Desktop, which sometimes has better MCP error logs for debugging.

***

If you want, I can help you create an example minimal HTTP JSON-RPC MCP server that passes this handshake and explain how to expand it to full MCP.

***

Summary:

Claude Code sends a JSON-RPC 2.0 `initialize` request with an ID and protocolVersion. You must respond immediately with a JSON-RPC 2.0 response with the same ID, matching protocolVersion, and no errors to establish connection.

If you do not follow this exactly, Claude Code will show "FAILED TO CONNECT."
