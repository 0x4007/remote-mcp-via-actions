# Deployment Status & Working Commit Documentation

## Last Known Working Deployment

**Working Commit Hash**: `76bd4b95`
- **Full Commit**: `76bd4b95 feat: Add aggressive enum validation patching for Grok aliases`
- **Server Used**: `src/bridge/server.js` (old bridge server)
- **GitHub Action**: `deploy-mcp.yml` (now saved as `deploy-mcp-working-reference.yml`)
- **Features**: Had 1-hour inactivity timeout, Cloudflare KV update, proper health endpoint

**Working Health Response Format**:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "protocol": "2025-06-18",
  "servers": 2,
  "uptime": <seconds>,
  "activeSessions": 0,
  "timeUntilTimeout": <seconds>,
  "commit": "76bd4b95"
}
```

## Current Deployment Status

**Current URL**: https://mcp.pavlovcik.com/health
**Current Response**: 
```json
{
  "status": "ok", 
  "healthy": true
}
```

**Analysis**: 
- This is NOT our Universal Gateway response format
- This is likely a minimal/fallback health check
- Missing commit hash, timeout info, server discovery data
- Indicates our Universal Gateway deployment is not working

## Regression Prevention

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT revert to commit `76bd4b95` or `src/bridge/server.js`

**Why**:
- That would abandon the Universal Gateway work
- Would lose 5-minute timeout feature (vs 1-hour)
- Would lose auto-discovery features  
- Would lose modern TypeScript architecture
- Would be a massive regression

**Goal**: Fix the Universal Gateway (`src/gateway/`) to work properly and deploy it successfully.

## Current Branch Status

**Working Branch**: `refactor/cleanup-2`
**Current HEAD**: `b831b025` (commit we're trying to deploy)
**Target**: Deploy Universal Gateway with features:
- 5-minute inactivity timeout
- Auto-discovery of MCP servers
- Health endpoint with full status info
- Proper commit hash reporting

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 1**: Test Universal Gateway locally (`src/gateway/test-gateway.sh`)
2. **Phase 2**: Manual MCP Inspector testing  
3. **Phase 3**: Deploy via GitHub Actions with proper monitoring

**Success Criteria**: `mcp.pavlovcik.com/health` returns detailed Universal Gateway response with current commit hash.
