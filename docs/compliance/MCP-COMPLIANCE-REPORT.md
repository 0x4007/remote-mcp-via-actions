# MCP Server Compliance Report

## Executive Summary
Your MCP server at `http://localhost:8081` is partially compliant with the MCP specification. It successfully implements basic tool functionality but lacks several key MCP capabilities.

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Working Features
1. **Initialize** - Server properly initializes and returns capabilities
2. **Tools** - Basic tool listing and calling works correctly
   - `calculate_sum` tool functional
   - `echo` tool functional
3. **Ping** - Server responds to ping requests
4. **Session Management** - Basic session handling works

### ❌ Missing Capabilities

#### 1. **Resources** (Not Implemented)
The server doesn't implement the resources capability, which allows exposing data/files to clients.
- Missing: `resources/list`
- Missing: `resources/read`
- Missing: `resources/subscribe`
- Missing: `resources/unsubscribe`

#### 2. **Prompts** (Not Implemented)
The server doesn't implement prompts, which allow predefined conversation templates.
- Missing: `prompts/list`
- Missing: `prompts/get`

#### 3. **Logging** (Declared but Not Implemented)
The server declares logging capability but doesn't implement the methods.
- Missing: `logging/setLevel`

#### 4. **Sampling** (Not Implemented)
The server doesn't support AI model sampling for message generation.
- Missing: `sampling/createMessage`

#### 5. **Completion** (Not Implemented)
The server doesn't support auto-completion features.
- Missing: `completion/complete`

#### 6. **Roots** (Not Implemented)
The server doesn't implement roots for file system navigation.
- Missing: `roots/list`

#### 7. **SSE Transport** (Broken)
The server attempts SSE support but returns wrong content-type (`application/json` instead of `text/event-stream`).

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Core MCP Features)
1. Fix SSE transport - Return proper `text/event-stream` content-type
2. Implement Resources - Essential for exposing data to AI clients
3. Implement Prompts - Important for guided interactions

### Medium Priority (Enhanced Functionality)
4. Fix Logging implementation - Already declared in capabilities
5. Implement Roots - Useful for file system operations

### Low Priority (Advanced Features)
6. Implement Sampling - For AI model integration
7. Implement Completion - For autocomplete functionality

## Quick Fixes Needed

1. **SSE Transport Fix**: In `handleMCPGet()`, change the Content-Type to `text/event-stream` when client accepts SSE
2. **Remove false capabilities**: Remove `logging` from capabilities since it's not implemented
3. **Add proper capability declarations**: Only declare capabilities that are actually implemented

## Next Steps

To make your MCP server fully compliant:

1. Start with fixing the SSE transport issue (quick win)
2. Implement Resources capability (most commonly used feature)
3. Implement Prompts capability (second most common)
4. Either implement or remove the logging capability declaration
5. Consider implementing Roots for file system access
6. Add Sampling and Completion for advanced AI features

The MCP Inspector is now running at http://localhost:6274 and can be used to test your server as you implement these features.
