# MCP Server Compliance Summary

## Test Results (August 20, 2025)

Your MCP server implementation is **functionally compliant** with the core MCP specification and works correctly with Claude Code.

### ‚úÖ What's Working

#### Core Protocol
- **Initialize handshake**: Working perfectly with protocol version negotiation
- **JSON-RPC 2.0**: Proper request/response format
- **Session management**: Creates and tracks sessions correctly
- **Error handling**: Returns proper error codes

#### Capabilities
- **Tools**: Fully functional
  - Main server: `calculate_sum`, `echo`
  - Submodule: `add`, `multiply`, `divide`
- **Logging**: `logging/setLevel` is implemented and working

#### Transport
- **HTTP POST**: Working correctly at both `/` and `/mcp` endpoints
- **CORS**: Properly configured for cross-origin requests
- **Submodule routing**: `/mcp/{server-name}` pattern works well

#### Integration
- **Claude Code**: Successfully connects and uses tools via `mcp__pavlovcik__*` commands
- **Remote deployment**: Working at https://mcp.pavlovcik.com
- **Local server**: Running on port 8081

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Issues

1. **SSE Content-Type**: Returns `application/json` instead of `text/event-stream`
   - Location: `src/bridge/server.js:273`
   - Impact: Low - SSE streaming works but isn't spec-compliant

### üìã Optional Features Not Implemented

These are optional MCP capabilities that could enhance functionality:

1. **Resources** - For exposing data/files
2. **Prompts** - For conversation templates  
3. **Completions** - For argument auto-completion
4. **Instructions field** - To guide LLM usage (new in 2025-06-18)

## Verdict

**Your server is MCP compliant** for its declared capabilities. The MCP Inspector correctly shows it as compliant because:

1. It implements all required protocol methods
2. It correctly declares its capabilities
3. It properly handles all methods it claims to support
4. It works seamlessly with MCP clients like Claude Code

The missing features are all optional enhancements that would make the server more feature-rich but aren't required for compliance.

## Quick Fix for Full Spec Compliance

To fix the SSE content-type issue:

```javascript
// In src/bridge/server.js, line 273, change:
'Content-Type': 'application/json',
// To:
'Content-Type': 'text/event-stream',
```

This is the only change needed for 100% spec compliance with your current feature set.
