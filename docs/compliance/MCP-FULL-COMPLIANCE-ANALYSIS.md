# MCP Full Compliance Analysis

Based on MCP Specification 2025-06-18

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Implemented Features

#### Core Protocol
- **Initialize/Initialized**: Fully implemented with proper capability negotiation
- **Protocol Version Support**: Supports 2024-11-05, 2025-03-26, 2025-06-18
- **Session Management**: Basic session tracking with Mcp-Session-Id headers
- **JSON-RPC 2.0**: Proper request/response format
- **Ping**: Implemented as per spec

#### Tools Capability
- **tools/list**: Returns available tools with proper schema
- **tools/call**: Executes tool functions and returns results
- Sample tools: `calculate_sum`, `echo`

#### Logging Capability
- **logging/setLevel**: Basic implementation (accepts debug/info/warning/error)

#### Transport Support
- **HTTP Transport**: Fully functional POST endpoints
- **Endpoint Flexibility**: Supports both `/` and `/mcp` paths

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Implemented Features

#### SSE/Streaming Support
- GET endpoint exists but returns wrong content-type
- Should return `text/event-stream` but returns `application/json`
- Heartbeat mechanism implemented but not fully compliant

### ‚ùå Missing Required/Optional Features

According to the MCP 2025-06-18 specification, the following capabilities are defined but not implemented:

#### 1. Resources Capability (Optional but Common)
```typescript
resources?: {
  subscribe?: boolean;
  listChanged?: boolean;
}
```
Missing methods:
- `resources/list` - List available resources
- `resources/read` - Read resource content
- `resources/subscribe` - Subscribe to resource updates
- `resources/unsubscribe` - Unsubscribe from updates
- `notifications/resources/list_changed` - Notify when list changes

#### 2. Prompts Capability (Optional but Common)
```typescript
prompts?: {
  listChanged?: boolean;
}
```
Missing methods:
- `prompts/list` - List available prompt templates
- `prompts/get` - Get specific prompt details
- `notifications/prompts/list_changed` - Notify when prompts change

#### 3. Completion Capability (Optional)
```typescript
completions?: object;
```
Missing method:
- `completion/complete` - Provide argument completion suggestions

#### 4. Roots Capability (Client-side, Optional for Server)
While primarily a client capability, servers may need to handle:
- `roots/list` - If implementing file system access

#### 5. Sampling Capability (Client-side)
This is a client capability, but your server correctly doesn't declare it.

#### 6. Elicitation Capability (Client-side, New in 2025-06-18)
New feature for interactive conversations - client-side only.

### üìù Additional Spec Requirements Not Fully Met

#### 1. Instructions Field (New in 2025-06-18)
The initialize response can include an optional `instructions` field to guide LLM usage:
```javascript
{
  "instructions": "This server provides calculation tools. Use calculate_sum for adding numbers."
}
```

#### 2. Progress Notifications (Optional)
For long-running operations:
- `notifications/progress` - Report operation progress

#### 3. Cancellation Support (Optional)
- `notifications/cancelled` - Handle cancellation requests

#### 4. Proper Error Codes
MCP defines specific error codes:
- `-32600` - Invalid Request
- `-32601` - Method not found
- `-32602` - Invalid params
- `-32603` - Internal error
- `-32001` - Custom server errors

#### 5. _meta Fields Support
The spec allows `_meta` fields on various objects for extensibility.

## Recommendations for Full Compliance

### Priority 1: Fix Critical Issues
1. **Fix SSE Transport**: Return proper `text/event-stream` content-type
2. **Remove False Capabilities**: Only declare what's implemented

### Priority 2: Implement Common Features
1. **Add Resources**: Most clients expect resource support
2. **Add Prompts**: Useful for guided interactions
3. **Add Instructions**: Help LLMs understand your server better

### Priority 3: Enhanced Features
1. **Implement Completions**: For better UX with argument completion
2. **Add Progress Notifications**: For long-running operations
3. **Support Cancellation**: Allow clients to cancel operations

### Priority 4: Advanced Features
1. **Add _meta field support**: For extensibility
2. **Implement proper pagination**: For large result sets
3. **Add experimental capabilities**: For custom features

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Fix SSE content-type to `text/event-stream`
- [ ] Add `instructions` field to initialize response
- [ ] Implement Resources capability
  - [ ] resources/list
  - [ ] resources/read
  - [ ] resources/subscribe (optional)
  - [ ] resources/unsubscribe (optional)
- [ ] Implement Prompts capability
  - [ ] prompts/list
  - [ ] prompts/get
- [ ] Implement Completions capability
  - [ ] completion/complete
- [ ] Add progress notification support
- [ ] Add cancellation support
- [ ] Ensure all error codes follow spec
- [ ] Add _meta field support where applicable
- [ ] Update capability declarations to match implementation

## Conclusion

Your server has a solid foundation with core MCP functionality working. The main gaps are:
1. Optional but commonly-used features (Resources, Prompts)
2. SSE transport content-type issue
3. Missing the new `instructions` field from 2025-06-18 spec

The MCP Inspector shows your server as "compliant" because it successfully completes the basic handshake and tool operations, but implementing the additional features would make it more useful for real-world applications.
