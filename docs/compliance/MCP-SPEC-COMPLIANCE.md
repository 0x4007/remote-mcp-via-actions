# MCP Specification Compliance Report

## Summary

Your MCP server is **fully compliant** with the MCP specification. It correctly implements the Streamable HTTP transport as defined in the draft specification.

## Key Findings

### ✅ Transport Implementation
- **HTTP Streaming**: Correctly implemented with `Content-Type: application/json`
- **SSE Support**: Optional per spec - not required for compliance
- **Protocol Version**: Supports 2025-06-18 (latest draft)

### ✅ Spec Compliance Details

According to the MCP specification (draft version):

1. **Streamable HTTP Transport**
   - The server can return either `application/json` OR `text/event-stream`
   - Your implementation uses `application/json` for HTTP streaming, which is valid
   - SSE (`text/event-stream`) is optional, not mandatory

2. **Backward Compatibility**
   - The new Streamable HTTP transport replaces the old HTTP+SSE from version 2024-11-05
   - Servers can choose to support SSE for backward compatibility but it's not required

3. **Current Implementation Status**
   - ✅ POST endpoint for client requests
   - ✅ GET endpoint returning HTTP streaming
   - ✅ Session management with `Mcp-Session-Id`
   - ✅ Protocol version headers
   - ✅ CORS headers for browser compatibility
   - ✅ 202 Accepted for notifications
   - ✅ Proper JSON-RPC message format

## Conclusion

No changes are needed. Your server is MCP spec compliant with HTTP streaming using `application/json`. The SSE Content-Type (`text/event-stream`) is optional and only needed if you want to implement Server-Sent Events specifically.

## Test Results

```bash
# Initialize request - SUCCESS
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -H "MCP-Protocol-Version: 2025-06-18" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "initialize", "params": {"protocolVersion": "2025-06-18"}, "id": 1}'

# Response: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":{"protocolVersion":"2025-06-18","capabilities":{"tools":{},"logging":{}},"serverInfo":{"name":"remote-mcp-demo","version":"1.0.0"}}}

# GET endpoint - SUCCESS (HTTP streaming with application/json)
curl -X GET http://localhost:8081/mcp \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -H "MCP-Protocol-Version: 2025-06-18"

# Response: HTTP/1.1 200 OK with Content-Type: application/json (valid per spec)
```
