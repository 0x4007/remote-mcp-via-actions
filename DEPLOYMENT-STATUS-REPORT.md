# MCP Server Deployment Status Report

## Executive Summary

The Remote MCP via Actions project aims to expose multiple MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers through a unified HTTP endpoint. While the core functionality works locally with 21 tools exposed (2 main tools, 3 calculator tools, and 16 Zen server tools), the production deployment at https://mcp.pavlovcik.com is currently experiencing issues with the Zen server tools not being exposed.

## Current Situation

### What's Working
1. **Local Environment**: All 21 tools are successfully exposed when running locally
   - Main server: `mcp__pavlovcik__calculate_sum`, `mcp__pavlovcik__echo`
   - Calculator server: 3 tools for arithmetic operations
   - Zen server: 16 AI-powered tools for various tasks

2. **Core Infrastructure**: 
   - STDIO-to-HTTP wrapper implementation is functional
   - Stateful connection handling for strict MCP servers implemented
   - Protocol version negotiation (2024-11-05, 2025-03-26, 2025-06-18) working
   - GitHub Actions deployment pipeline established
   - Cloudflare tunnel integration operational

### What's Not Working
1. **Production Deployment**: 
   - Only 5 tools exposed (missing all 16 Zen server tools)
   - Cloudflare tunnel error 1033 reported (may be resolved with latest deployment)
   - Zen server submodule not properly initialized in GitHub Actions

2. **GitHub Actions Issues**:
   - Submodule checkout not working correctly despite `submodules: true` flag
   - Multiple cancelled workflow runs during debugging attempts
   - Direct git clone approach implemented but not yet verified in production

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Zen Server Protocol Compliance
The Zen MCP server requires strict adherence to the MCP protocol specification, specifically:
- **Critical Fix**: Must send an `initialized` notification after receiving the `initialize` response
- **Implementation**: Added in `src/bridge/stdio-wrapper.js` lines 161-166
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed locally, pending production verification

### Secondary Issue: GitHub Actions Submodule Handling
The Zen server exists as a git submodule but isn't being properly checked out in CI:
1. Standard `actions/checkout@v4` with `submodules: true` doesn't initialize the Zen submodule
2. Manual `git submodule update --init --recursive` also failed
3. Implemented workaround: Direct `git clone` of Zen repository (lines 62-82 in deploy-mcp.yml)

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Protocol Compliance Fix (Completed Locally)
```javascript
// src/bridge/stdio-wrapper.js - Send initialized notification
const initializedNotification = {
  jsonrpc: '2.0',
  method: 'notifications/initialized',
  params: {}
};
processInfo.process.stdin.write(JSON.stringify(initializedNotification) + '\n');
```

### 2. Stateful Connection Management (Completed)
- Added `requiresStatefulConnection` flag in `mcp-servers/config.json`
- Implemented connection pooling with proper lifecycle management
- Maintains persistent processes for servers requiring state

### 3. GitHub Actions Deployment Fix (In Progress)
Current approach in deploy-mcp.yml:
```yaml
- name: Clone Zen MCP Server
  run: |
    rm -rf mcp-servers/zen-mcp-server
    git clone https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/zen-mcp-server.git mcp-servers/zen-mcp-server
```

## Attempted Solutions

### 1. Submodule Checkout Attempts
- ✅ Added `submodules: true` to checkout action
- ❌ Manual `git submodule update --init --recursive` 
- ❌ Separate submodule init and update commands
- ✅ Direct git clone (current solution)

### 2. Environment Configuration
- ✅ Added OPENROUTER_API_KEY to GitHub secrets
- ✅ Pass environment variable to server process
- ✅ Install Python 3.11 and Zen server dependencies

### 3. Timeout Adjustments
- ✅ Changed server timeout from 15 minutes to 1 hour
- ✅ Updated all timeout messages in documentation

## Current Deployment Status

**Latest Workflow Run**: #17091064315 (running - Keep server running step)
- ✅ Successfully cloned Zen server repository
- ✅ Installed Python dependencies for Zen
- ✅ Server is running at: https://interference-suppliers-adaptor-cord.trycloudflare.com
- ❌ Zen server not initialized - only shows 1 submodule (calculator)
- ❌ KV update skipped - production URL not updated due to endpoint test failure
- ❌ Only 5 tools exposed (missing 16 Zen tools)

**Active Tunnel URL**: https://interference-suppliers-adaptor-cord.trycloudflare.com/health
- Status: Healthy but incomplete (missing Zen server)
- Uptime: ~6 minutes
- Submodules: Only example-calculator loaded

## Critical Finding

The Zen server is being successfully cloned and its dependencies installed in GitHub Actions, but it's not being initialized by the submodule-manager. This suggests the issue is in the server discovery or configuration loading phase, not in the submodule checkout.

**Likely Root Cause**: The `mcp-servers/config.json` file may not be correctly identifying the Zen server directory after the direct clone, or the server initialization is failing silently.

## Next Steps for Completion

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Debug Zen Server Initialization**
   - Check if `mcp-servers/zen-mcp-server/server.py` exists after clone
   - Verify the config.json correctly points to Zen server
   - Add debug logging to submodule-manager.js to see why Zen isn't loading
   - Check if OPENROUTER_API_KEY is being passed correctly to Python process

2. **Fix Server Discovery**
   - Ensure submodule-manager.js finds the cloned Zen directory
   - Verify the server.py file has correct permissions
   - Check Python path and environment setup

3. **Production Validation**
   ```bash
   # Test production endpoint
   curl https://mcp.pavlovcik.com/health
   
   # Add to Claude Code for testing
   claude mcp add --transport http custom-demo https://mcp.pavlovcik.com/
   
   # Verify Zen tools are available
   # Should see tools like: zen-mcp-server__list_models, zen-mcp-server__generate_text, etc.
   ```

## Configuration Files Reference

### Key Files Modified
1. **src/bridge/stdio-wrapper.js**: Core protocol implementation with initialized notification
2. **mcp-servers/config.json**: Server configurations with stateful connection flags
3. **.github/workflows/deploy-mcp.yml**: Deployment pipeline with Zen server clone fix
4. **src/bridge/server.js**: 1-hour timeout configuration

### Environment Requirements
- Node.js 20+
- Python 3.11 (for Zen server)
- OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment variable
- npm dependencies installed

## Testing Instructions

### Local Testing
```bash
# Start local server
cd src/bridge
npm install
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key node server.js

# In another terminal, test with MCP Inspector
# Should see all 21 tools listed
```

### Production Testing
```bash
# Check health endpoint
curl https://mcp.pavlovcik.com/health

# Add to Claude Code
claude mcp add --transport http mcp-demo https://mcp.pavlovcik.com/

# List available tools (should show 21 tools)
# Use Claude Code to verify Zen tools work
```

## Known Issues & Workarounds

1. **Submodule Checkout**: Use direct git clone instead of submodule commands
2. **API Key Requirements**: Zen server requires OPENROUTER_API_KEY to function
3. **Cloudflare Tunnel Stability**: May need to dispatch new workflow if tunnel expires

## Support Information

- **Repository**: https://github.com/0x4007/remote-mcp-via-actions
- **Production URL**: https://mcp.pavlovcik.com
- **Protocol**: MCP Streamable HTTP (not SSE)
- **Expected Tools Count**: 21 (2 main + 3 calculator + 16 Zen)

## Handoff Notes

The primary remaining task is to ensure the production deployment successfully exposes all 21 tools. The local implementation is complete and working. The GitHub Actions workflow has been updated with a direct git clone approach that should resolve the submodule issue. Monitor the current deployment and verify all Zen server tools are accessible in production.

Priority checklist for completion:
- [ ] Verify workflow #17091064315 completion
- [ ] Test production endpoint for all 21 tools
- [ ] Confirm Zen server tools are functional
- [ ] Update documentation if any additional changes needed
